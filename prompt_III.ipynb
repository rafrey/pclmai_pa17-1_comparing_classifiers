    "\n",
    "- **Business objective (Problem 4):** Develop a classification model to identify customers most likely to subscribe (predict `y = 'yes'`) so marketing/sales efforts can prioritize outreach. Because missed likely subscribers (false negatives) are more costly than unnecessary outreach (false positives), the objective prioritizes recall of “yes” (i.e., reducing false negatives) even if precision decreases. However, false positives (contacting unlikely subscribers) also incur a real cost in the form of wasted call-center time and potential customer fatigue, so we cannot simply accept a model that predicts \"yes\" for everyone. The trade-off is balanced by emphasizing $F_2$, which weights recall more heavily but still penalizes precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Success criteria:** Success will be defined by improving positive-class performance relative to a baseline model: (a) higher cross-validated and test-set $F_2(\\text{yes})$ and recall(yes) than the baseline (DummyClassifier and/or untuned Logistic Regression), and (b) maintaining an operationally feasible predicted-positive rate (e.g., by selecting a threshold or top-$k$ policy) so outreach volume stays within capacity.\n"

Operationally, the model must support **ranking/thresholding (top‑k selection)** so the bank can target the highest-propensity segment within outreach capacity, and we will reject configurations that are operationally degenerate (e.g., predicting “yes” for nearly everyone)."

    "#### Changes to Improve and Tune Models\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To align CV + scoring to the business objective I have decided to use F2 (beta=2) because in this busines context\n",
    "false negatives (sales lost to call never made) are more costly than false positives (calls made not resulting in a sale).\n",
    "Using F2 (beta=2) gives us a validation metric that prioritizes recall while still penalizing very low precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note: `f2_yes_scorer` and `cv` are declared in the global variables cell near the top of the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![Confusion Matrix Performance Metric Visualization](images/cmpm.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Using the above visualization as an aid, we can map the Confusion Matrix directly to business decisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   **Left Side (Predicted 'No' - Do Not Call):**\n",
    "        *   **False Negatives (FN):** Missed opportunities. We failed to call a customer who would have bought. The cost here is the **lost margin** ($V$) from the foregone sale.\n",
    "    *   **Right Side (Predicted 'Yes' - Call):**\n",
    "        *   **True Positives (TP):** Successful sales. We gain the **margin** ($V$) minus the **contact cost** ($c$).\n",
    "        *   **False Positives (FP):** Wasted effort. We incur the **contact cost** ($c$) without generating revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Balancing Uplift, Margin, and Cost:**\n",
    "    As defined via the profit impact formula at the end of the notebook in the Model Deployment section (Cell 53), our goal is to maximize the net value of our outreach. \n",
    "    *   Increasing **Uplift** (converting more customers) often requires a model with higher Recall (fewer FNs), which generates more \"Call\" recommendations.\n",
    "    *   However, making more calls inevitably produces more False Positives, increasing aggregate **Cost**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Therefore, a model that maximizes uplift is only viable if the **Margin** ($V$) from the additional captured sales outweighs the **Cost** ($c$) of the extra unproductive calls. Additionally, since such a model increases the total volume of calls, we must ensure we have the labor capacity to handle the increased workload.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. I will additionally switch to pipelines that leverage the existing ColumnTransformer preprocessing pipeline\n",
    "with a classifier model and operate on split data that has not been preprocessed to avoid data leakage."

    "##### Methodology: Unsupervised Clustering for Supervised Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unsupervised vs. Supervised Learning:**\n",
    "Unlike the other classifiers used in this notebook (Logistic Regression, KNN, SVC, Decision Trees), which are *supervised* learning algorithms that learn directly from labeled examples ($y$), K-Means is inherently an *unsupervised* clustering algorithm designed to find natural groupings in data ($X$) without reference to labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "To adapt this unsupervised technique for our supervised classification task, we employ a **\"Clustering-then-Labeling\"** strategy:\n",
    "1.  **Clustering:** The algorithm partitions the feature space into $k$ clusters based on geometric proximity.\n",
    "2.  **Labeling:** Each resulting cluster is assigned a class label (e.g., 'yes' or 'no') based on the majority vote or purity of the training samples that fall within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This effectively turns the clustering algorithm into a classifier: a new sample is classified based on the label of the nearest cluster centroid.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation Details & Wrappers:**\n",
    "The `DataCentricKMeans` library is a standalone C++ implementation optimized for geometric clustering. Because it does not conform to the standard Scikit-Learn API (`fit`/`predict`), we implemented a custom wrapper class, `GeometricKMeansClassifier` (see Helper Functions), to bridge the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key integration steps handled by the wrapper include:\n",
    "*   **Data Conversion:** The library requires input data as a CSV file path rather than in-memory arrays. The wrapper automatically handles the I/O overhead of writing the training data to a temporary CSV file before execution.\n",
    "*   **Purity-based Labeling:** To address class imbalance, the wrapper implements a `purity_threshold`. Instead of a simple majority vote (which would almost always result in 'no' for every cluster due to the rarity of term deposits), a cluster can be labeled 'yes' if the proportion of positive samples exceeds a tunable threshold (e.g., 10%), drastically improving potential recall."

    "\n",
    "Because the target class (`y = 'yes'`) is relatively rare, **accuracy can be misleading**: a model can achieve high accuracy by predicting mostly (or only) “no”, yet have little value for identifying likely subscribers. For this reason, the grid searches above use **$F_2$ on the positive class** (“yes”), which weights recall more heavily than precision. This aligns with the stated business objective where **false negatives** (missing a likely subscriber) are more costly than false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key observations from the tuned confusion matrices and the tuned comparison table:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Logistic Regression (tuned)** achieves the strongest overall balance for this objective in these results: it attains the highest **Test $F_2$** by substantially increasing recall for “yes” (fewer false negatives), but at the cost of many **false positives** (predicting “yes” when actual is “no”).\n",
    "- **Decision Tree (tuned)** improves recall compared to conservative baselines, but its **Test $F_2$** is lower than tuned Logistic Regression, indicating a weaker recall/precision tradeoff under the $F_2$ objective on this test split.\n",
    "- **SVM [SVC] (tuned)** selected a configuration that effectively predicts “yes” for nearly everyone (confusion matrix shows essentially no predicted “no”). While this yields recall $\\approx 1.0$ and can score well on recall-heavy metrics, it is typically **operationally unacceptable** because it overwhelms downstream outreach capacity with false positives and collapses overall accuracy.\n",
    "- **KNN (tuned)** remains relatively conservative on the positive class in the final tuned results (low recall for “yes”), which leads to a low **Test $F_2$** despite high accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Problem 11 demonstrates that **changing the validation metric changes model behavior**. Optimizing $F_2(\\text{yes})$ pushes models toward predicting more “yes” to capture positives (higher recall). The “best” model under $F_2$ should therefore be selected not only by the metric itself but also by whether its confusion-matrix tradeoffs are feasible given real marketing/outreach constraints.\n",

    "- **Important preprocessing note:** `age` is **standardized** (via `StandardScaler`), so its coefficient corresponds to a **1 standard-deviation increase** in age, not a one-year increase.\n",
    "- **One-hot encoding note:** categorical variables are one-hot encoded. Because no single category is explicitly treated as the reference category in this encoding, interpret category coefficients primarily by **comparing categories within the same feature** (e.g., odds ratio between categories $a$ and $b$ is $\\exp(\\beta_a - \\beta_b)$).\n",
    "- **Regularization note:** the tuned model used elastic-net with `l1_ratio=1.0` (L1), so many coefficients may be exactly 0; non-zero coefficients can be viewed as the subset of features retained by the model under the recall-prioritized objective ($F_2$).\n",

    "Model selection is based on aligning with the business objective (false negatives are more costly than false positives) while also ensuring the model’s behavior is operationally feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Criteria used:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Primary criterion: maximize $F_2(\\text{yes})$ on held-out test data** to emphasize recall of likely subscribers while still penalizing extremely low precision.\n",
    "- **Confusion-matrix sanity check:** prefer models that reduce false negatives without producing an unmanageably large number of false positives.\n",
    "- **Operational feasibility:** the predicted-positive rate must be compatible with call-center/sales capacity; otherwise the model must be paired with a thresholding/ranking strategy.\n",
    "- **Interpretability and maintainability:** Logistic Regression provides a straightforward baseline with stable training/prediction behavior and clear coefficients (useful for stakeholder communication).\n",
    "\n",
    "Rationale:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tuned Logistic Regression** achieved the highest **Test $F_2(\\text{yes})$** among the tuned candidates, indicating the best alignment with the recall-prioritized objective of this evaluation.\n",
    "- **Tuned SVC** is rejected despite strong recall because it degenerates into predicting nearly everyone as “yes”, which is not practical for deployment.\n",
    "- **Tuned Decision Tree** offers an interpretable alternative but delivers a lower **Test $F_2$** than Logistic Regression in these results.\n",
    "- **Tuned KNN** underperforms on recall and $F_2$ for the “yes” class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: if business constraints require fewer false positives (limited outreach capacity), a possible next step would be to deploy Logistic Regression as a **ranker** (probability scoring) and choose an operating point (threshold/top-$k$) that meets capacity while monitoring recall impacts."

    "#### Model Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "To validate real-world impact and ensure the deployed model meets the business objective (reducing false negatives while remaining operationally feasible), deployment should include both **experimental evaluation** and **ongoing monitoring**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Counterfactual evaluation (recommended):** use an experiment to estimate causal lift versus a control condition. This can be an **A/B test** or a **clustered randomized controlled trial** (e.g., randomize call centers, sales teams, or time blocks). This aligns with the need for counterfactual outcomes discussed in the course materials.\n",
    "- **Define the operating policy:** because $F_2$ optimization tends to increase predicted positives, select an operating point that respects outreach capacity. Practical options include:\n",
    "  - set a probability threshold for “yes”, or\n",
    "  - contact the top-$k$ ranked customers by predicted probability.\n",
    "- **Monitor post-deployment performance:** track confusion-matrix-derived metrics over time—especially **recall(yes)**, **precision(yes)**, and **$F_2(\\text{yes})$**—as well as the predicted-positive rate (employee workload).\n",
    "- **Data/Concept drift and retraining:** monitor shifts in input distributions and outcome rates; schedule periodic re-training and re-validation to maintain $F_2$ and recall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a clustered randomized control trial for this setting might include randomly choosing a subset of call centers (or sales-associate groups) to use the model-driven targeting strategy while others continue the current process, then compare subscription outcomes and resource usage between treatment and control groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "To quantify the model’s impact on the organization’s bottom line in real dollars, the cleanest approach is to convert the experiment’s **incremental lift** into **incremental profit**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let\n",
    "\n",
    "- $N_T, N_C$ = number of customers contacted (treatment, control)\n",
    "- $\\hat p_T, \\hat p_C$ = observed subscription rates among those contacted (treatment, control)\n",
    "- $V$ = average profit (or contribution margin / LTV) per incremental subscriber\n",
    "- $c$ = variable cost per contact (call/email/etc.)\n",
    "- $F$ = fixed deployment cost over the measurement period (integration, training, tooling)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then an incremental-profit estimate is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta \\Pi\n",
    "=\n",
    "\\Big(N_T(\\hat p_T V - c) - F\\Big)\n",
    "-\n",
    "\\Big(N_C(\\hat p_C V - c)\\Big)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the experiment contacts the same number of customers in each group ($N_T=N_C=N$) and per-contact cost is the same, this simplifies to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta \\Pi \\approx N(\\hat p_T-\\hat p_C)V - F\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This connects model deployment directly to business value: the term $\\hat p_T-\\hat p_C$ is the causal lift (counterfactual effect), $V$ translates lift into dollars, and $c$ and $F$ account for operational and implementation costs."

    "#### Summary of Findings (Nontechnical)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this model is for (in plain language):**\n",
    "- The goal is to **prioritize which customers to contact** for a term-deposit offer by estimating who is *more likely* to subscribe (`y = yes`).\n",
    "- Because missing a likely subscriber is considered more costly than contacting an unlikely one, the modeling and tuning emphasized **finding more of the “yes” cases** (higher recall).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bottom-line recommendation:**\n",
    "- Use **Tuned Logistic Regression** as a **scoring model** that ranks customers by likelihood to subscribe.\n",
    "- Operationally, contact either the **top-$k$** customers (ranked by predicted probability) or those above a chosen **probability threshold**—whichever best matches outreach capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tradeoffs and operational risks to be aware of:**\n",
    "- Prioritizing recall (via $F_2(\\text{yes})$) typically increases the number of predicted “yes” customers. This means:\n",
    "  - **Fewer missed opportunities** (fewer false negatives), but\n",
    "  - **More false alarms** (more false positives), which can overload call-center/sales capacity and increase contact costs.\n",
    "- Some tuned models (e.g., SVM in these results) can become **operationally unusable** by predicting “yes” for almost everyone. This is why confusion-matrix review and capacity constraints matter, not just a single metric.\n",
    "- Coefficients help explain the model, but this is still a statistical model: relationships may shift over time (campaign design, macroeconomic changes, customer mix), so performance must be monitored.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to validate business value (not just model metrics):**\n",
    "- Treat deployment as an experiment and measure **incremental lift** versus current practice (control), using an **A/B test** or **clustered randomized trial** (e.g., by call center, team, or time block).\n",
    "- Track both **business outcomes** (subscriptions, incremental profit) and **operational outcomes** (contacts per day, acceptance rate, and customer experience signals).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Monitoring after launch:**\n",
    "- Monitor **precision(yes)**, **recall(yes)**, and **$F_2(\\text{yes})$** over time, plus the **predicted-positive rate** (workload).\n",
    "- Watch for **data drift** (input distributions changing) and **concept drift** (the relationship between features and subscription changing), then retrain/recalibrate thresholds as needed.\n",
